# Recommendations
* I would recommend that the strategies that were in place in October where highest profit was recorded can be implemented in other months to reduce percentage loss.
  
* Customers who generated highest revenue should be rewarded either by giving discounts on next purchase or giving them gift vouchers to enhance customer
satisfaction, retention and loyalty.

* Lastly, an indepth ananlysis should be carried out to find out why some countries recorded poor sales and measures put in place to ensure an increase
in sales from those countries.
